# witairepo
Repo for the wit.ai app
The project uses the power of wit.ai and Its Python's API to perform the sentiment analysis and classify the student's opinion of a Physics course at the FIUBA (Facultad de Ingener√≠a Universidad de Buenos Aires).
First, you have to create the wit.ai API and get the token to connect the API with your Python script. Then the script reads the opinions from a Google Sheet and validates the opinion intents using wit.ai API, then writes back the opinion in another Google Sheet and lets the doors open to rate the course.
